# Sells-Point Node with Express Server

Welcome to the **Sells-Point Node with Express Server** repository! This project aims to provide a platform where users can easily buy or sell used products. Here's a more comprehensive breakdown:

## Package

1. **Node.js and Express**:
   - The API is built using Node.js and the popular web framework Express.
   - Express simplifies routing, middleware handling, and request/response management.

2. **Mongoose**:
   - We use Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
   - Mongoose provides a schema-based solution for defining data models and interacting with the database.
   - Schemas define the structure of documents, including field types, validation rules, and default values.

3. **Mongoose Schema**:
   - We define schemas for various data entities (e.g., users, sell posts).
   - Schemas allow us to enforce consistency and validation rules for data stored in MongoDB.

4. **Mongoose Aggregation Pipeline and Lookup**:
   - For complex queries, I leverage the Mongoose aggregation pipeline.
   - The `$lookup` stage allows us to perform joins between collections, enabling efficient data retrieval.

5. **JWT Tokens for Security**:
   - We secure our API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
   - JWTs are issued upon successful authentication and used for subsequent requests.
   - They help maintain user sessions and prevent unauthorized access.

6. **Multer and Cloudinary**:
   - Multer handles file uploads (e.g., images) from clients.
   - Uploaded files are stored in Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service.
   - Cloudinary provides secure storage, image transformations, and easy retrieval via URLs.

7. **Password Hashing with bcrypt**:
   - User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
   - Hashing ensures that passwords remain confidential even if the database is compromised.

8. **Environment Variables (Stored in .env)**:
   - Sensitive information (e.g., database connection strings, API keys) is stored in a `.env` file.
   - This separation of secrets from code enhances security.

9. **Role Verification Middleware**:
   - We implement middleware to verify user roles (e.g., user vs. admin).
   - Admins have additional privileges (e.g., managing user accounts, reviewing posts).

## Design Pattern

- The project adheres to the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern.
- Separating concerns into models, views (not applicable in backend APIs), and controllers promotes maintainability.

## Deployment

- The backend is deployed on **Render**, a cloud platform known for simplicity and scalability.
